# 🐍 Titanic Survival Analysis (Python Version)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python to understand survival patterns. It repeats the same questions as my R-based project — this time using pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib — as part of my portfolio in both tools.

---

## 📊 Analysis Questions

1. Did gender affect survival likelihood?  
2. Did traveling with family influence survival?  
3. How does family size relate to outcome?

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Colab)  
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
- Markdown (for project documentation)

---

## ✅ Key Steps

- Cleaned and explored data (EDA)  
- Created `FamilySize` and `TravelAlone` features  
- Visualized survival by gender, travel status, and family size

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

**1. Gender and Survival**  
Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate (~75%) than male passengers (~20%). This aligns with historical evacuation practices that prioritized women and children.

**2. Traveling Alone vs With Family**  
Passengers traveling with family had a higher survival rate (~50%) compared to those traveling alone (~30%). This suggests the presence of family may have provided emotional support or increased prioritization during evacuation.

**3. Family Size and Survival**  
Survival rates were highest among passengers with small family sizes (1–3), peaking at FamilySize = 3. Solo travelers had much lower survival rates, and very large families (4+) also showed a decline, likely due to coordination challenges in emergencies.
